# Support

## Getting Help

Use GitHub Issues for:

- bug reports
- feature requests
- documentation gaps
- release/process questions

Include clear reproduction steps, expected behavior, actual behavior, and environment details.

## Before Opening an Issue

1. Read `README.md`.
2. Run local checks:
   - `npm run typecheck`
   - `npm run i18n:check`
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm run test`
3. Search for existing issues and discussions.

## Security Issues

Do not report vulnerabilities in public issues.

Follow `SECURITY.md` for private reporting.

## Response Expectations

Maintainer response times depend on availability. Security and release-blocking regressions are prioritized.
